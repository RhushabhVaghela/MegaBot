MegaBot is a production-ready, local-first AI assistant that unifies the world's most powerful agentic frameworks into a single, secure, and modular brain. By combining the execution power of **OpenClaw**, the proactive memory of **memU**, the tool-standardization of **MCP**, and the terminal-centric philosophy of **OpenCode**, MegaBot delivers a future-proof agentic experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Unified Action Engine (via OpenClaw & MCP)
- **Omni-Channel Execution**: Seamlessly communicate across WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, and SMS.
- **Universal Tooling**: Standardized integration with 1000+ MCP servers (Filesystem, Google Maps, GitHub, etc.).
- **Approval Interlock**: Sensitive system commands are queued for human approval before execution—keeping your host machine safe. You can approve or deny actions directly from your messaging app.

### 2. Neuro-Proactive Memory (via memU)
- **Hierarchical Storage**: Three-layer memory (Resource -> Item -> Category) for long-term context retention and relationship mapping.
- **Layered Fetching**: Fetches data in abstracted layers, allowing the system to handle massive amounts of context without overloading the context window.
- **Intent Prediction**: Anticipates user needs based on historical patterns and current context (Proactive Memory).

### 3. Native Secure Messaging
- **Encrypted WebSocket**: A custom, high-performance channel for mobile and web clients using Fernet (AES-128) encryption.
- **Zero Telemetry**: All data stays on your local machine—no external pings, no cloud tracking.
- **Full Control**: Command your bot, approve/deny actions, and revoke access using simple chat commands (`!approve`, `!deny`, `!allow`, `!mode`).

### 4. Unified Gateway (Cloud Sync)
- **Triple-Layer Access**: Built-in support for **Cloudflare Tunnels** (Public), **Tailscale VPN** (Private Mesh), **Direct HTTPS**, plus localhost fallback.
- **Security First**: Rate limiting, health monitoring, and secure mesh networking via Tailscale ensure your gateway is safe to use.

### 5. Multi-Modal Vision & Safety 👁️🛡️
- **Visual Redaction Agent**: Automatically detects and blurs sensitive regions (API keys, passwords, faces) in outbound screenshots before they reach the admin.
- **Verification Audit**: Uses a secondary vision pass to confirm redaction success. Unsafe images are permanently blocked.
- **Approval Escalation (IVR)**: If a critical approval is ignored for 5 minutes, the bot proactively calls your phone via Twilio (respecting DND hours) to seek authorization via voice.

### 6. Sovereign Identity & Continuity 👤🔄
- **Identity-Link**: Unifies your chat history across Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, and WebSockets.
- **Context Continuity**: Seamlessly switch from your phone to your desktop while maintaining the same "Working Memory".
- **Self-Healing Heartbeat**: A proactive monitor that detects adapter failures and automatically attempts to restart crashed components.
- **Encrypted Backups**: Automated 12-hour encrypted snapshots of the memory database.

### Message Lifecycle

1. **External Platform** → Messaging adapter receives message
2. **Platform Normalization** → Converted to standard `PlatformMessage`
3. **Orchestrator Processing** → Memory lookup and context augmentation
4. **Security Check** → Approval interlock for sensitive actions
5. **Tool Execution** → MCP servers or native tools
6. **Response Generation** → LLM generates response
7. **Platform Delivery** → Response sent back via appropriate adapter

## 📦 Feature Modules

The `features/` directory contains specialized modules and integrated project documentation:

- **`dash_data/agent.py`** — DashDataAgent for CSV/JSON analysis with sandboxed Python execution
- **`*_README.md`** — Integrated documentation for 8 sub-projects: DASH, TIRITH, MEMU, OPENCLAW, NANOBOT, PAGE_INDEX, AGENT_LIGHTNING, AGENT_ZERO

See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for the full deep-dive.

## 🔒 Security Model

1. **The Sandbox**: All execution happens inside Docker, isolating your Windows/Linux host.
2. **The Firewall**: MegaBot acts as a proxy for OpenClaw, filtering and intercepting dangerous RCE commands.
3. **The Interlock**: You are the final authority. System-level commands require a physical click to execute.

### Key Security Features
- **Command Sanitization**: All shell commands are validated and sanitized
- **Approval Workflows**: Sensitive operations require explicit human approval
- **Encrypted Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all messaging
- **Visual Redaction**: Automatic detection and blurring of sensitive content
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions and policy enforcement

---

## 🧪 Testing

We maintain rigorous engineering standards with comprehensive test coverage.

### Running Tests

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=core --cov=adapters --cov-report=html

# Run specific test suite
pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py
```

### Test Coverage
- **Backend (Python)**: `pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing`
- **Current**: 1373 tests passing across all core modules (**~96% coverage**)
- **Components**: Core components, adapters, async testing with proper mocking
